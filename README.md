# Propellant-properties-calculate
# All propellant properties are calculate by Nasa CEA.
# This program calculate the propellent properties of hybrid rocket with different chamber pressure, OF ratio and expansion ratio.
# Deafault calculation results includes cstar, isp, specific heat ratio, molecular weight, flame temperature and pressure in chamber or nozzle throat or nozzle exit. Thrust coefficient and vacuum ISP are also available from CEA. Just need a little modification of this program.
# Deafault propellant is hydrogen peroxide and HTPB combination, it can be replce by other propellant data.
# To execute this program, CEA should be placed in the same floder with program file.
